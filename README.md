# Crossway game project

from: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30517/crossway

Crossway is played with a Go set. White's goal is to connect the left and right edges of the board with a **contiguous** sequence of stones, and Black's goal is to connect the top and bottom edges. Unlike Go, you can connect diagonally, so there are eight directions of connectivity in Crossway.

You can’t crosscut, so if your opponent already has connected two stones diagonally adjacent, you’re not allowed to place a stone that would create two mutually crossing adjacent diagonals.

Draws and ties cannot occur in Crossway.

The only illegal moves are
